Morse code detector was developed using PSOC Creator which is an IDE that supports the "C" programming language. 
The application detects knocks in a specific pattern or scalar multiples of the pattern to unlock a 12V lock. 
The knocks are detected by using a piezo buzzer.
This application was powered with a 10V power supply with an NMOS transistor to limit the current drawn and a PSOC LP5 board.
